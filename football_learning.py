### 🥅 The Art of Goalkeeping

**1. Positioning Fundamentals**
- **The Arc Principle**: Always position yourself on an imaginary arc between the ball and the center of the goal
- **Angle Play**: The closer the attacker, the more you come off your line to cut angles
- **Near Post Priority**: Never get beaten at your near post - it's the cardinal sin
- **6-Yard Box Control**: This is your domain - command it with authority

**2. Shot Stopping Technique**
- **Set Position**: Feet shoulder-width apart, weight on balls of feet, hands at hip height
- **The "W" Catch**: For high balls, form a W with your hands behind the ball
- **Low Dives**: Lead with your bottom hand, top hand secures
- **Power Shots**: Get your body behind the ball when possible
- **1v1 Situations**: Make yourself big, stay on feet as long as possible

**3. Distribution Excellence**
- **Quick Release**: Best counter-attacks start from goalkeeper's hands
- **Target Areas**: Wide to fullbacks in space, or central to deep midfielder
- **Goal Kicks**: Vary between short build-up and long to target man
- **Throwing Technique**: Bowling for accuracy, javelin for distance

**4. Communication & Command**
- You see the entire field - be the defensive organizer
- Key calls: "Away!", "Keeper's!", "Hold!", "Push up!"
- Organize your wall for free kicks: "Three in the wall!", "No gaps!"
- Constant information to defenders about blind-side runners

**5. Mental Strength**
- Mistakes are magnified - develop short memory
- Stay focused during quiet periods
- Confidence is contagious - project it to defenders
- Routine is key - develop pre-game and in-game rituals

**Pro Tip from Buffon**: "The goalkeeper is the jewel in the crown. Getting at him should be almost impossible. He should be protected like a son."

**Training Drills**:
1. **Angle Work**: Cones at different angles, practice positioning
2. **Reaction Saves**: Tennis ball against wall for reflexes
3. **Distribution**: Targets at different distances
4. **Cross Claiming**: High balls with pressure
